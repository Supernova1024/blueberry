How do you make financial software better? The answer let financail professionals build it. This was the idea for the 
Blueberry App. 


Our team built this app with the work flow of CPA and accountant in mind to solve the problem of populating IRS documents for mid size to large company with looks of vendors. We decided to design and app making the complex simple with direct functions and clutter.

This application allows users to enter companies and the contractors or connect to popular Quickbook software and from there information can be populated to create 1099 forms for each contractor.

We have cut the clutter of more popular software to do a simple task well.
