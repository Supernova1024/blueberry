How do you make financial software better?  Let financial professionals build it. This was the idea for the 
Blueberry App.


Our team built this app with the workflow of CPAs and accountants in mind to solve the problem of populating IRS documents for mid-size to large companies with lots of contractors. We decided to design an application that does one task well, populate 1099s.

This application allows users to enter company and contractor data manually or connect to popular account software Quickbooks and import the data.

We have cut out the clutter of popular cluncky, overpriced softwares and made something simple , sweet easy and as easy to use as making Blueberry... pie!
